# SpecGan
Spectrogram generator using GANs


I started this project as part of my Bachelor Thesis:
"Generator of graphic representations of phonic signals using GAN neural networks"
and develop it for learning purpose. 
 

## To do
Model: 
- Add TensorBoard
- Add results and checkpoints for (drums, female, male)
- Work with learning rate


Data preparation: 
- Add section to convert generated spectrogram to audio
