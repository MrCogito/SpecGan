# SpecGan
Spectrogram generator using GANs


I started this project as part of my Bachelor Thesis:
"Generator of graphic representations of phonic signals using GAN neural networks"
and develop it for learning purpose. 
Based on DCGAN with tf: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan
-add noise to disc 
-change kernel to 1dimention 
-normalize to 0-1
 Datasets: 
 https://www.hexawe.net/mess/200.Drum.Machines/
 vctk corpus
 

## To do
 - Add project description to readme

Model: 
- Add results and checkpoints for (drums, female, male)

Data preparation: 
-Add dynamic normalization to created samples based on dataset
