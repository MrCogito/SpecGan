# SpecGan
Spectrogram generator using GANs


I started this project as part of my Bachelor Thesis:
"Generator of graphic representations of phonic signals using GAN neural networks"
and develop it for learning purpose. 
 

## To do
 - Add project description to readme

Model: 
- Add images to tensorboard
- Add results and checkpoints for (drums, female, male)
- Work with learning rate (no sure if needed)


Data preparation:
